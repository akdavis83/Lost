    <p>All who wander are not lost. In terms of the natural realm, in terms of space and time, that may be entirely true. We have maps, compasses, gps, and all kinds of modern day navigational items. In terms of the things we can see with our senses we have this mortal sphere mapped out pretty well. But at the same time new things are being discovered all the time and the things that we thought we knew, we are finding that we did not know as well as previously thought. The earth was flat for centuries and the idea was vehemently defended as absolute truth. When it comes to the realm of the invisible, the world would have you to believe that there is no way to know with certainty what lies beyond the senses. But this is far from the truth. Infact, we have a more sure word that will never pass away. We have a road map and the path is to eternal life. Life more abundant and true that starts at the moment of decision. The realm beyond is mapped out with precision, if one dare travel the narrow road. The idea of eternity, of life never ending, is mind boggling, perplexing, and mind bending, to say the least. If such a thing were true, and it is, that would mean that life would be the real one. That would mean that, that life is the true substance and this one is the shadow. This life is the test, and the test is so simple most fail it. The test is the same one given to Adam. It is the test of choice. Will you choose to believe or refuse and go your own way? If you have ever failed at anything, and we all have. If you have ever seen an optical illusion that you thought was true but it wasn't, and we all have, then maybe what you now see, isn't what you thought it was. Wander no more. Don't just take my word for it. Pick up a New Testament, read for your self and I believe that the Holy Spirit will illuminate its pages and will make the content jump off the page and become a living reality in your life today. In Jesus mighty name I pray, Amen.</p>

    <p>(Exodus 22:9) For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

    <p>9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Rom 10:9-13)</p>
    <p>Are you counted among the lost today? Do you see, feel, know, and recognize your need for a Saviour? The scriptures say and promise if you will believe and confess Christ as Lord and Savior, you will not be denied. No need to wander any longer. No need to wonder any more. If you have taken the time to recieve Christ as Lord and Savior, congratulations and welcome to the God's family as a new creature in Christ. Nothing will ever be the same again, He will take you on from glory to glory, with ever increasing glory until the end of your mortal story. Everlasting life is the precious gift bestowed upon you this day! Rejoice!</p>
